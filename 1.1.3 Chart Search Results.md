# Chart Search Results
In the Aggregates tab, in addition to the standard table view, you can view search results as a chart, such as a **bar** or **column chart.**

When charting aggregate results from a query, the grouping function defines the plotted values on the one axis, and the grouping operator determines the values on the other axis. For example, **group by** `_sourceHost` produces a bar or point for each host. If you're using multiple group-by functions, a separate bar or point represents each set of grouped results.

## Chart aggregate results
Follow the below instructions to chart aggregate the results:

1.From a search, run an `aggregate` **query**.

2.From the Aggregates tab, click a `graph` **button** on the Aggregates tab.

For this example, you can see a bar chart, but you can pick from any of the available charting options.

### New Visualizations
Clicking the **New Visualizations** button will enable the new visualizations for your log search chart, also helping you to customize each chart by modifying the available settings and providing a unified experience across the Sumo Logic platforms.

Charts will appear in classic visualization style by default. However, if you choose a new visualization, your selection will be remembered, and any further searches in the same or new tab will always render with the new visualization.

**Data** represents the data that has been used to plot chart, `Round data` point toggle button is used to turn **ON/OFF** the round off to the value in tooltip, and the `Visual Settings` options allow you to **customize your chart**. The other customizing properties include Display Overrides, Axes, Legend, Thresholds, and JSON.

If you prefer to use the **classic visualizations UI**, you can do so by clicking the Classic Visualizations button. You'll be asked to confirm your choice, Click Switch to `Classic Visualizations` to proceed.
