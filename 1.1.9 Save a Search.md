# Save a Search
Whether you are running ad hoc searches during a forensic investigation or running standard searches for health checks, you can save any search to run again later.

When you create a search that you'd like to reuse, you can save it to the Library. From there you can run it again, share with others, edit the search, or create a Scheduled Search to run at a regularly scheduled time, and set up alerts. 

The saved search will also include any charts you have created in the Aggregates tab. 

### To save a search:

1.Run a search you'd like to save.

2.(Optional) After the search results are complete, in the **Aggregates tab**, select a chart type to display the data visually. 

3.Save the search using one of these methods:
  - Click the **save icon** on the top right of the search page.
