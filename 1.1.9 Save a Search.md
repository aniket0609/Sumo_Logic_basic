# Save a Search
Whether you are running ad hoc searches during a forensic investigation or running standard searches for health checks, you can save any search to run again later.

When you create a search that you'd like to reuse, you can save it to the Library. From there you can run it again, share with others, edit the search, or create a Scheduled Search to run at a regularly scheduled time, and set up alerts. 

The saved search will also include any charts you have created in the Aggregates tab.
