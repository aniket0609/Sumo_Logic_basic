# Chart Search Results
In the Aggregates tab, in addition to the standard table view, you can view search results as a chart, such as a **bar** or **column chart.**

When charting aggregate results from a query, the grouping function defines the plotted values on the one axis, and the grouping operator determines the values on the other axis. For example, **group by** `_sourceHost` produces a bar or point for each host. If you're using multiple group-by functions, a separate bar or point represents each set of grouped results.

## Chart aggregate results

New Visualizations
Clicking the New Visualizations button will enable the new visualizations for your log search chart, also helping you to customize each chart by modifying the available settings and providing a unified experience across the Sumo Logic platforms.

Charts will appear in classic visualization style by default. However, if you choose a new visualization, your selection will be remembered, and any further searches in the same or new tab will always render with the new visualization.

FAQ
Why are the chart options not available?
Your data may be a string data type instead of a number. Most aggregate operators will cast your data to a number, operators like first and last do not. You can cast your data to a number if needed using the num operator.

Example:

_sourceCategory=concierge completed execution
| parse "Execution duration: * s" as duration
| timeslice 5m
| first(duration) as duration by _timeslice
| num(duration)
| sort by duration

For details on casting your data to a string or numeric data type see Casting Data to a Number or String for details.
